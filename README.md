## Overview

The Pathfinding Visualizer is a web-based application designed to demonstrate various pathfinding algorithms in action. Users can interact with a grid, set start and end points, and visualize how different algorithms navigate through obstacles to find the shortest path. This tool serves as an educational resource for understanding how algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search work.

## Features

-   **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end nodes, and toggle walls to create obstacles.
-   **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from multiple pathfinding algorithms to visualize their respective processes.
-   **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the algorithm work in real-time, highlighting each step taken to find the path.
-   **Reset Board**: Clear the board and reset the grid to its initial state with a single click.


## Technologies Used

-   **Vite**: A fast development build tool that provides a smooth and efficient development experience.
-   **React**: For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
-   **TypeScript**: For type safety and enhanced development experience.
-   **CSS**: For styling the application and creating an engaging user interface.
-   **Custom Algorithms**: Implementations of Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
